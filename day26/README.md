# Day 26 - Intermediate - List comprehension and the NATO alphabet
This day covers dictionary and list comprehensions. This is unique to the Python language and cuts down on the amount of code while working with dictionaries and lists.

## The video lessons are:
196. Day 26 goals: what you will make by the end of the day
197. How to create lists using list comprehension
198. Apply list comprehension to the US States game
199. How to use dictionary comprehension
200. How to iterate over a Pandas DataFrame
201. Introducing the NATO alphabet project
202. Solution & Walkthrough for the NATO alphabet project

## Day 26 Project
The project for today is a NATO phonetic alphabet converter where the user will enter a word and it will be converted to the phonetic alphabet.

### Files provided
- main.py
- nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv

## Thoughts
Todays project was actually not as difficult as I expected it to be when compared to the previous few days. I found myself wanting to work on it a little bit longer, so I added a loop functionality to enter multiple words until the user decides they're finished. Comprehensions seems like a very valiuable tool, and it surprises me that (according to the videos as of Feb 2025) other programming languages do not have this function.
