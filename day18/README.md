138. Space out your study sessions and stay consistent


## Day 18 Project
The project for today is to develop a Hirst Painting by randomly generating dots across the screen to create works of art.

Example:

### Project files
- None *The code snippit for the colorgram module & the rgb colors section

## Thoughts
Today didn't feel like too difficult of a project. The biggest difficulties I had was mathing out how to evenly space the dots on the painting, 
and also remembering the process for creating a venv and installing modules on a project by project basis, as apparently it installed the modules in the day 16 venv. I will have to continue learning about venvs to prevent this problem in the future. Other than that, it was mostly just referencing the documentation for the imported modules (turtle, colorgram, etc).
