# Day 19 - Intermediate - Instances, State, and Higher Order Functions
This day covers more turtle graphics, but also touching on event listeners, higher order functions, states, and multiple instances of an object. 

## The video lessons are:
139. Day 19 Goals: What we will make by the end of the day
140. Python higher order functions & event listeners
141. Challenge: Make an etch-a-sketch app
142. Object state and instances
143. Understanding the turtle coordinate system
144. Aaaand, we're off to the races!
145. Expand on the solutions


## Day 16 Project
The project for today is to create a turtle race with multiple turtle objects acting independantly of one another.

### Files Provided:
- main.py - The file was provided, but doesn't do anything by default except import the Turtle and Screen module. 

## Thoughts
Todays project seemed similar to yesterdays, where it was not really a "do it on your own" sort of project, but a work together with the video project. Although the concepts weren't very difficult, it was still a fun project to go through. I feel like I thought a little too much about the turtle layout for the starting locations to make sure they were semi-even.
