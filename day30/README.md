# Day 30 - Intermediate - Errors, Exceptions, and JSON data: Improving the password
This day covers more advanced topics such as error, exceptions, and learning how to save and load JSON data. 

## The video lessons are:
227. Day 30 goals: what you will make by the end of the day
228. Catching exceptions: The try catch except finally pattern
229. Raising your own exceptions 
230. Exception handling in the NATO phonetic alphabet project
231. Write, read, and update JSON data in the password manager
232. Challenge 1: Handling exceptions in the password manager
233. Challenge 2: Search for a website in the password manager

## Day 30 Project
The project for today is adding a search function into the password application that references stored JSON data, and handling exceptions so the app doesn't crash.

## Thoughts
I can already tell just from this lesson the power of error catching is immense. Especially with how unpredictable users can be. The benefit of using this just with the password manager created yesterday is very valuable and I can't wait to create more programs that I can use within actual environments.
