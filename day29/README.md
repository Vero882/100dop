## Thoughts
This project was actually a lot of fun to me. It was nice to put effort into something functional rather than just a game. It really got me thinking about how I could improve on something like this, such as moving away from saving a file locally and perhaps instead automatically uploading it to an Azure Keyvault, or at least remote storage.
