# Day 35 - Intermediate+ Keys, Authentication & Environment Variables: Send SMS
This day covers API kets, authentication, environment variables, and sending SMS with Python. These are most advanced ways of using APIs by authenticating with an API to get more secure and valuable data. 

## The video lessons are:
267. Day 35 goals: what you will make by the end of the day
268. What is API authentication, and why do we need to authenticate ourselves?
269. Using API keys to authenticate and get the weather from OpenWeatherMap
270. Challenge - Check if it will rain in the next 12 hours
271. Sending SMS via the Twilio API
272. Can't use SMS? Try WhatsApp instead
273. Use PythonAnywhere to automate the Python script
274. Undeerstanding environment variables and hiding API keys

## Day 35 Project
The project for today is to build an SMS application to send us an alert if it's going to rain that day.  

## Thoughts
This is a very interesting project. These are the kinds of things that I think about when I think of useful programming, outside of automating tasks within an environment at least. There were a couple of small difficulties, mostly due to Twilio. Since the video was created they have changed their terms for trial accounts, and it seems you can only message a Twilio internal number on a free trial account. Any messages to external numbers get filtered out until you apply payment to your account. Regardless of that, I was able to test the app utilizing their built in virtual number and everything worked great.
