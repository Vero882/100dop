## Thoughts
Today was pretty fun. I never would have thought about combining multiple turtles together to create a line for a snake game. At the beginning of the day, I thought we might be using a different Python package other than Turtle to create a snake game. It really opened my mind up to think a little more outside the box. I'm looking forward to working through part 2 tomorrow to complete the additional items for the game, and excited to see where I can apply all the concepts I've been learning to use in the real world with tasks in an enterprise environment.
