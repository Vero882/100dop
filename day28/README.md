## Thoughts
While this lesson today felt mostly guided, I went off on my own here and there to try an accomplish things on my own. It's very interesting to see how much more capable Tkinter feels over Turtle for custom GUI applications. The ability to import images and configure the layout of items similar to HTML/CSS (but much simpler) is quite interesting and opens the door for a lot of possibilities for custom projects.
