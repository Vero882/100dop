# Day 39 - Intermediate+ Capstone part1: Flight deal finder
This day is part one of a capstone project for API understanding. Utilizing a combination of APIs, create a cheap flight finder application. 

## The video lessons are:
293. Day 39 goals: what you will make by the end of the day
294. Step 1 - Choose your path and download the starting project
295. Step 2 - Use Sheety to read and write data to the Google Sheet
296. Step 3 - Get the IATA codes using Amadeus
297. Step 4 - Search for cheap flights
298. Step 5 - If the price is lower than in the sheet, send a message

## Day 39 Project
The project for today is a cheap flight finder application. Part one will find flight deals for ourselves, while part two (day 40) will turn the project into a full SaaS application that accepts additional users.

## Thoughts

### Day 39
Unfortunately, after fighting with this for two days I have yet to have any success. This, like many other individuals in the course have said, is the *hardest* project we've seen to date by a long shot, with very little guidance. The lack of any video explainations in the course material doesn't help. I don't want to waste too much time fighting with this project, but maybe I can return to it in the future when I understand some concepts better, and/or utilize better API resources. 

### Day 40
I will be skipping day 40 for now as it builds from day 39. Including day 39 not being completed, I'm sure my Sheety API tokens are majorily used up, so I will likely be unable to do this lesson even if I tried.
