## Day 37 Project
The project for today is creating a habit tracker app uusing an API called Pixela. 

## Thoughts
I really like this project. It's not very "user" friendly, but I think utilizing either Tkinter or just input commands for the console would be nice to track habits. I could definitely see myself using this since it's familiarly styled like the GitHub tracker.
