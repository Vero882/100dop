# Day 33 - Intermediate+ API Endpoints & API parameters - ISS Overhead Notifier
This day covers the basics of application programming interfaces. 

## The video lessons are:
251. Day 33 goals: waht you will make by the end of the day
252. What are application programming interfaces (APIs)
253. API endpoints and making API calls
254. Working with responses: HTTP codes, exceptions, and JSON data
255. Challenge - Build a Kanye quote app using the Kanye rest API
256. Understand API parameters: Match sunset times with the current time
257. ISS Overhead notifier project - Challenge & Solution

## Day 33 Project
The project for today is to create a tracker that alerts when the ISS is overhead, and it will then send an email with an alert.

## Thoughts
This was a very interesting use of code. It's interesting that you can put so many things together all at once (ISS API, Sunrise/set API, etc) for a simple project result. These days there are many more sophisticated ways to achieve this (like the actual ISS tracking how app), but it was still very interesting to see how you can capitalize on APIs for a project you build.
