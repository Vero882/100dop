## Day 16 Project
The project for today is converting the coffee machine (created in day 15) into an OOP version. The files below have been provided for the start of the project:
### Main Program
- main.py
### "External" library (**Do not edit**)
- coffee_maker.py
- menu.py
- money_machine.py

## Thoughts
Overall, the day 16 project was pretty simple since it was built from the day 15 project, but also because some of the files were provided.
It was intended more as an introduction to *interacting* with classes, rather than creating them myself.
