# Day 27 - Intermediate - Tkinter, *args, **kwargs, and creating GUI programs
This day covers a more common tool for creating GUIs: Tkinter. This includes creating labels, creating buttons, responding to button clicks, text inputs, etc. It also covers more in depth Python functions, such as setting default arguments.  

## The video lessons are:
203. Day 27 goals: what we will make by the end of the day
204. History of GUI and introduction to Tkinter
205. Creating windows and labels with Tkinter
206. Setting default values for optional arguments inside a function header
207. *args: Many positional arguments
208. **kwargs: Many keyword arguments
209. Buttons, entry, and setting component options
210. Other Tkinter widgets: Radiobuttons, Scales, Checkbuttons, and more
211. Tkinter layout managers: pack(), place(), and grid()
212. Mile to kilometers converter project

## Day 27 Project
The project for today is creating a Miles to Kilometers converter GUI program. It will take a user input of miles, and produce the converted amount of kilometeres.  

## Thoughts
I really like the tkinter library. It will be handy to create my own basic programs to make things a little less intimidating for a user that isn't comfortable utilizing CLI. It's also really nice that it's simple enough to program things into it, though I'm sure it can get much more complicated the more you add.
