## Day 22 Project
The project for today is creating the Pong game from Atari. 

## Thoughts
Todays project was interesting. I tried doing the majority of it on my own, which lead me to using the teleport method initially instead of the goto method due to simplicity for speed. This caused issues with accessing the starting coordinates I wanted to use, and thus I had to use the goto method instead. I also noticed on my computer the update delay of 0.1 was much too slow, and I had to adjust to 0.05 to make the game appear smooth when played.
